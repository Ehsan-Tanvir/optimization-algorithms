# Operations Research Algorithms in R  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This repository contains implementations of various **Operations Research** algorithms using **R**. These algorithms are widely used for **optimization, decision-making, and resource allocation** problems in fields such as logistics, economics, and engineering.  

## ðŸ“‚ Algorithms Included  
### ðŸ“Œ **Linear Programming & Optimization**  
- **Gauss-Jordan Algorithm for Simplex (Maximization & Minimization)** â€“ Solves linear programming problems using the **Simplex method**.  
- **Least Cost Transportation Algorithm** â€“ Finds the optimal transportation plan with minimum cost.  
- **Hungarian Algorithm for Assignment Problems** â€“ Solves assignment problems efficiently.  

### ðŸ“Œ **Dynamic Programming Problems**  
- **Knapsack Problem** â€“ Determines the most valuable items to fit within a weight limit.  
- **Minimum Cost Path (MCP)** â€“ Computes the lowest cost to reach the last cell of a grid.  
- **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)** â€“ Finds the shortest possible route that visits each city once and returns to the start.  

## ðŸš€ How to Use  
Each algorithm is implemented as an **R function** and can be executed by running the respective script. To test the algorithms, load the script in **RStudio** or execute it in an R environment.
